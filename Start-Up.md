# Start-Up Procedure

<!-- TODO: put a picture here with a general layout and a note that it is subject to change -->

On the right panel:

1. Flip "Main Battery" switch to "On"
2. Flip "Brake Lock" switch to "On" (this is so you don't accidentally roll while starting up)
3. Flip "APU" switch to "On" (it is a covered switch, so you need to lift the cover first)
4. Wait for the RPM gauge under the "APU" switch to spool up
5. Flip the covered switch for one of the engines to "On" (you can try both at once, but you are likely to have start failures)
6. Wait for the engine to spool up (RPM gauges for the engines are on the front panel on the right side)
7. Flip the covered switch for the other engine to "On" and wait for it to spool up
8. Flip "APU" switch to "Off" (you don't need it once the engines are running)

Front panel:

1. Flip "HUD Power" switch (you don't *need* it, but it's a good idea to have on)

From there, everything is based on what you're going to do and how you're going to do it.
